                        <h4>What is treasury of bitcoin?</h4>
                        <p>A Bitcoin treasury refers to the strategic holding of Bitcoin by a company as a reserve asset. Some companies focus on acquiring Bitcoin and may issue debt instruments or raise capital to accumulate more Bitcoin, effectively treating it as a core part of their financial strategy or business model.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How would they make money?</h4>
                        <p>The company profits if the price of Bitcoin increases at a rate higher than the interest they pay on their debt. Essentially, they're betting that the appreciation of Bitcoin will outweigh the cost of borrowing.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Why will the price of bitcoin rise?</h4>
                        <p>Bitcoin is still in its price discovery phase, where its long-term value is being established. Future price appreciation largely depends on broader adoption, clearer regulatory frameworks, and easier institutional and retail access—all of which have shown encouraging progress in the past year.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What investment grade are MSTR debt instruments?</h4>
                        <p>MicroStrategy's debt and preferred instruments are generally rated below investment grade, typically falling in the B+ to CCC+ range. The exact rating depends on factors such as the structure of the issuance, whether it's secured or unsecured, and its convertibility features.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What is the activity for MSTR debt products in secondary markets?</h4>
                        <p>MicroStrategy's debt products have seen varied but notable activity in secondary markets:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>STRK</strong>, launched in early 2025 at $80/share raising ~$563M, quickly became one of the top-performing perpetual preferred securities, with trading volume approximately 7× higher than comparable instruments.</li>
                            <li><strong>STRF</strong> offers a 10% base dividend, with potential compounding up to 18%. It has experienced moderate uptake, though it remains less liquid than STRK.</li>
                            <li><strong>STRC</strong>, issued in July 2025, is designed to resemble short-duration Treasury bills. Initially priced at $90 with a ~10% yield, it introduces monthly variable dividends. Given its size and investor demand, STRC is expected to surpass earlier preferreds in terms of liquidity and visibility.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Analysis: The Perpetual Funding Model</h4>
                        <p>For a highly speculative and volatile currency like Bitcoin, the treasury functions much like a perpetual swap (perp), using interest rates as a funding cost. The sustainability of such a model depends heavily on continuous price appreciation. When Bitcoin prices rise over long periods, demand remains confident both for holding Bitcoin and for associated debt instruments used to fund positions. However, extended periods of downward price movement or increased volatility can significantly dry up this demand. Investors grow cautious, reduce leverage, and may exit positions, impacting liquidity and the treasury's operational model. This dynamic can sustain itself only for a limited time horizon while market sentiment favors growth and volatility remains high.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the long term, as Bitcoin matures, volatility is expected to decrease and prices may stabilize, similar to other asset classes like gold that initially experienced high volatility before settling into broader acceptance. When volatility reduces and price movements stabilize, the perpetual funding model tied to volatility and interest rates becomes less effective. The treasury can no longer rely on funding rates derived from speculation and leverage, restricting growth opportunities in debt instruments tied to Bitcoin. Such a regime shift necessitates adapting financial structuring and may require new instruments or models as market maturity progresses and speculative demand diminishes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>In summary, Bitcoin's treasury and funding model works while volatility and speculative demand are high but may become unsustainable as the asset matures and volatility declines over time.</p>
