                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A self-driven technologist with a journey that spans from assembling computers and working aboard ships as a marine engineer, 
                to mastering data systems and building crypto data products. Passionate about decentralization, I bring 3+ years of experience 
                in the digital asset space—creating robust data pipelines, automating analytics, and delivering insights on market structure and 
                blockchain dynamics.</p>

                <p>I started by taking apart computers as a teenager — not always knowing how to put them back together, but always curious about how things worked. That same mindset led me to the high seas, where I worked as a marine engineer keeping massive ship engines running across oceans.</p>
                
                <p>But beneath the engine grease, my interest in systems — especially decentralized ones — kept growing. I discovered Bitcoin in its early days and was fascinated not just by the asset, but by the architecture. That rabbit hole led to trading, investing, and eventually a complete pivot: I began studying computer science, data systems, and blockchain technology.</p>
                
                <p>Over the last few years, I've transitioned fully into tech, working as a crypto data engineer building pipelines that power digital asset analytics. From building ETL flows for real-time exchange data to designing dashboards tracking liquidity, I now work at the intersection of markets and infrastructure.</p>
                
                <p>I still love complexity — whether it's mechanical or mathematical — but today, the engine rooms I work on live in code, APIs, and blockchains.</p>
